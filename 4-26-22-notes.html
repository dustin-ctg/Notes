      <li class="standard-list-item"> The way buddyboss builds the path is by trail slashing the plugin_dir_path to the plugin file and then the bp_source_subdirectory, which is just an empty string I guess? We could probably just do a trailing slashed stylesheet directory for this.</li>
      <li class="standard-list-item"> How do they increment their action ids and stuff in the database? That's wild</li>
